  "<p>Lack of rain is depleting surface water sources for those in the agriculture industry. Even worse, warmer and drier conditions result in crops requiring more water than usual. According to <a href='https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/josu%C3%A9-medellin-azuara' target='_blank'>Josué Medellín-Azuara</a>, Associate Professor from UC Merced, this implies a further discrepancy in the water supply and irrigation demands, leading to farmers digging deeper for water underground.</p>" +
  "<p>According to a report from the <a href='https://www.ppic.org/publication/water-use-in-california/' target='_blank'>Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC)</a>, around 40% of the water in California is used by the agricultural industry, 10% urban, and 50% environmental. Farming uses up 80% of all water under the businesses and homes category, though it only accounts for about 2% of the state’s gross state product.</p>";

  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>For Soiseth, a smaller farmer with less seniority in California's complicated system of water rights, the ongoing drought means that less water will be allocated for the same amount plot. Soiseth has two parcels of almond farms that receive water from different sources. On one of his farms, he receives surface water from the Turlock Irrigation District (TID). TID is one of the oldest irrigation districts in California, with its own water rights independent from the state and federal water systems.</p>" +

  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Before the drought became severe, Soiseth used to receive an average of 32 inches of water from TID each year. However, this has been cut to 18 inches. This means 18 inches of water has to be spread out on the same patch of land that used to receive 32 inches. The reduced amount of water stresses out the trees and forces earlier irrigation.</p>" +
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>His other patch of land uses drip irrigation by pumping groundwater because he has no other source of water for this land. Due to the drought, Soiseth had to rip out a pump and dig 150 feet into the ground with three other farmers, which cost him around $75,000. These farmers had no choice but to tap into new water reserves.<br></br></p>" +

Conditions improved in 2019, but he says his almond trees will soon be exhausted again from the current drought.</p>" +

  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Almonds are a water-intensive crop, and the agriculture and water use in California are currently under major political debate. Tensions have arisen between the water use policies for agriculture and conservation due to water scarcity. This year, the Central Valley Project, a federal program that delivers water to the region through dams, reservations and canals, has not planned any allocation of water to the agriculture sector. State water officials also cut water allocation from the State Water Project, now delivering 5% to farmers instead of 15%. Consequently, farmers receive less surface water allocation while the drought continues and water on the market becomes less affordable. This turns some farmers to rely heavily on extracting groundwater from wells. The more and more frequent groundwater extraction comes in conflict with the 2014 California Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) that aims to conserve and manage groundwater levels.<br></br></p>";

  "<p>These issues often make almond farmers a target for people who want to see the state's dwindling water resources put to other uses. <a href='https://www.c-win.org/carolee-krieger' target='_blank'>Carolee Krieger</a>, the President and Executive Director of the California Water Impact Network (C-WIN), said it is the Central Valley’s megafarms in particular that dominate the limited water supply. The Resnicks control 57% of the Kern Water Bank that was originally authorized as an emergency water supply for ratepayers. The megafarms receive large water allocations from the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project and can afford to pay increasing water rates, while smaller farmers often cannot.<br></br></p>";

Some farmers actually convert to growing high commodity crops to afford higher water rates.</p>';

  '<p>The current outlook on the agriculture industry looks challenging. Smaller almond farmers are becoming more disadvantaged during severe drought conditions whereas megafarms continue to reap the benefits of almond farming. The current almond farming practices are unsustainable if the drought continues at this severity and farmers pump more groundwater.</p>' +
  '<p>Medellín-Azuara explains that the surface cutbacks and SGMA will further  intensify water scarcity for both agriculture and urban areas. Yet he gave a few policy suggestions that the state could implement to increase water resiliency. For example, SGMA now requires irrigation districts to come up with sustainable water management plans. It is hoped that those plans impose constraints on irrigation water use and incentivize local farmers to grow a healthier mix of permanent and annual crops. A more sustainable farming practice would impose less constraint to water resources while supporting the farms financially.</p>';
