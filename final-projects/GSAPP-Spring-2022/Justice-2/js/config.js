  "<p>While investigating a single allegation of police misconduct, New Orleans Deputy Police Monitor Bonycle Sokunbi spent 350 hours pouring over footage captured by body-worn cameras. Especially in cases of use of force, monitors can’t judge a case by the footage captured during the incident,  'we're not looking at just that individual use of force. We're looking at what led up to it, all the tactics, and the behavior that took place.' </p><p></p>" +
  "<p>Body Worn Cameras were officially introduced in New Orleans in 2015, since then officers have activated the cameras over 3,900,000 times. </p>"+
  "<p>In 2021 alone, body worn camera footage totaled over 27,000 hours, with a median length of 7 minutes. How does a metro area of 1,270,000 handle so much data, where is it collected, and where does it go?</p>"+

"<h3>TRANSPARENCY & BODY-WORN CAMERAS</h3>" +  
'<p> When asked if the work the OIPD does with body-worn cameras could serve as a modelfor other police departments, Cziment and Sokunbi had reservations: " I dont want to conflate body-worn cameras with transparency. There are departments using body-worn cameras that do not release the footage." If a police departments only reason for implementing body-worn cameras is to limit their liability, they may be disincentivized to be transparent about bad actors in their ranks. </p>'+
"<p> Policies about using body camera footage matter, because wearing a body camera alone does not change the behavior of officers. Looking over hours of footage has shown Sokunbi that most officers tend to forget theyre wearing an activated camera: 'The number of times you see someone going to the bathroom. They just forget and theyre going to act how theyre going to act. Its just now we are able to weed out the bad actors by observing their behavior. </p>"+
"<p>These observations correspond with numerous studies on how BWCs affect police behavior. According to a 2019 review of 70 studies on body-worn cameras, researchers, 'found no statistically significant or consistent effects in decreasing police use of force.' (ACLU) Opponents of expanding their use in lieu of stronger reforms, cite their inefffectiveness coupled with potentially invesive breaches of privacy. </p>"+
"<p> While Sokunbi has first hand experience with issues of privacym behavior and cost, shes expressed at least one immediate upside: 'BWC provide accountability on behaviors that otherwise might go unknown. I cant say that the punishment necessarily deters the behavior, but at least there is punishment.' Released properly, Cziment thinks body camera footage increases community trust in the NOPD, and may provide necessary emotional closure: 'the NOPD releases body camera footage of officers involved in shootings and gives private viewings to the families of victims and officers involved in the incident.'</p>"+
"<h3>THE FUTURE OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY IN NEW ORLEANS</h3>" +
"<p> For the OIP, the future points to a collective approach. For Cziment, 'OIMP is looking to empower and inform the community organizations to be their own police monitor.' OIMPs educational model centers around bringing awareness of police expectations and civilian rights. They hope to bring community organizations in contact with individuals who are underreporting police misconduct to play a more prominent role in collecting those narratives when reporting back to them. Cziment adds to the importance of data producers being cognizant of their data's role in police reform. 'We need everyone to be on the same page about how this reform will move forward to avoid accidentally taking steps back.' For the OIPM BWC are only enffective when supported by policies that more hilistically address the feelings of the citizens towards the police. Notably, body-worn camera footage is not viewed in mediation sessions, which according to Cziment are not 'about what actually happened or what was actually said. It is about how people felt they were heard or not heard.' </p>"+
"<h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>"+
"<p>We would like to thank Juan Saldarriaga & Michael Krisch for a challenging, yet rewarding semester. Lauren Tierney for her brilliant help in guiding us through the story. Morgan Williams, for his expert advice and resources. Bonycle Sokumbi and Stella Cziment from the office of the Independent Police Monitor in New Orleans, for their gracious time and expertise. And Thomas Abraham for his help and support throughout the project.</p>";

  '<p class="imageCredit">Body-worn cameras by Duration</p>' +
  '<p>Officers must turn their cameras on during almost any interaction with the public. Cameras must stay on until they leave the scene. </a></p>' +
  "<p>As admissible evidence in all misconduct investigations, body worn cameras have added a complex and time consuming new layer of legal responsibility for the Office of the Police Monitor–the top police accountability watchdog in New Orleans. Nonetheless, Bonycle  'can't imagine a world doing this adequately without body worn camera footage. The amount of guessing that takes place or assumptions that are made could be dangerous without it.' </p>";

  '<p class="imageCredit">Median income by sensus district vs. Body Camera Activations by duration.</p>' +
  "<p>A small team of 5, the OIPM has a lot on their plate. Acting as a go-between the New Orleans public and NOPD, they receive and prepare complaints for the NOPD public integrity bureau, monitor, review, and assess all misconduct cases, attend all disciplinary hearings, and organize mediation services between individual officers and complainants. For all of these tasks, body worn camera footage has become vital for the simple reason that, as acting Independent Police Monitor Stella Cziment says, they are  ”a way for us to be able to verify what actually happened on the scene.” providing equal footing for the people who file misconduct complaints and the officers involved in the incident.</p>"+
  "<p>As Cziment sees it, the presence of Body Worn Cameras also lessens the burden on mistreated citizens to report misconduct, for whom there “might be a lot of fear or a lack of knowledge about them being mistreated.” According to public data released by the City of New Orleans, 35% of misconduct claims were “rank initiated.”  BWC footage allows for a supervisor to make in depth reviews of incidents involving their officers and themselves “cut a number” (file a misconduct claim) against that officer. The mistreated citizen may never know about the claim, but  “all of this work is being done to improve this officer and to hold this officer accountable.”  In New Orleans, It’s up to the police monitor to ensure that the process remains transparent, fair and thorough.  </p>";

  '<img src="images/misconduct complaints-01.png">' +
  // '<p class="imageCredit"></p>' +
  "<p> Despite its relatively inexpensive implementation, body-worn cameras present shortcomings beyond monetary costs. According to the annual costs & benefits report for body-worn cameras in policing, maintenance of equipment and topics related to civilian privacy are areas cited as improvement for the technology. In additionm the all-encompassing nature of the device requires large amounts of footage to be redacted to prevent infractions regarding privacy laws. A sentiment shared by Sokunbi as she recounts: BWC all of a sudden record everything. They create a record of information of people that dont want to be seen.</p>";
  // "<p>When asked if the work the OIPD does with body-worn cameras could serve as a model for other police departments, Cziment and Sokunbi had reservations: ” I don't want to conflate body-worn cameras with transparency.
