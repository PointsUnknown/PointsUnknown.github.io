  "<h1>What Does It Mean To Be GullahGeechee</h1>" +
  '<p>The Sea Islands that stretch from the Carolinas to Florida, are home to the Gullah Geechee people. These barrier islands are ancestral lands that have survived since the times of slavery, and are imbued with the rich culture of numerous african ethnic groups who brought with them their own language, craft and traditions.</p>' +
  '<p>Such cultural traditions have undoubtedly shaped the south and are at risk of extinction. After nearly 300 years, the last preserved GullahGeechee coastal community on Sapelo Island continues to tend to their roots in the face of dual threats. Gullah Geechee Nation is facing severe hurricane and coastal zone speculation across barrier islands.</p>' +
  '<p>In the face of long-term population decline, climate change and other threats, the community returns to Sapelo Island to shore up their land and what remains.With Hurricane season right around the corner, coastal communities are combating speculation to preserve their ties to the land.</p>'+

  "<p> During the 1840s over 400 slaves were brought to the island from West Africa and the West Indies to work on fields of cotton, indigo and sugar cane. They were the ancestors of the current and former island settlers.In 1945, there were around 500 Geechee residents on Sapelo Island. By the mid-1970s, only about 150 Geechee residents remained.  The 2009 census listed 47 Gullah-Geechee residents residing on Sapelo. Over the course of 77 years, today on the island, the Gullah-Geechee community have lost more than 90% of their population compared to 1945; there are only 39 full-time Gullah-Geechee residents left.</p>"+
  "<p>“The communities vanished one by one. Now, only one remains.” Hog Hammock, the last Gullah-Geechee settlement on the island, is one of the thirteen/fifteen African American Saltwater Geechee settlements on Sapelo Island.</p>"+
  "<p>Compared to other barrier islands such as Hilton Head, where population has been increasing drastically since the 1950s due to tourism and land development, Sapelo’s issues with population decrease and lots of vacancies left the remaining Geechee people fighting along with the external forces, especially the seasonal hurricanes.</p>"+

  '<p>Because of their low-lying location, the barrier islands along coastal Georgia are often in the path of hurricanes and tropical storms. Coastal communities, specifically those who remain on Sapelo Island, are overwhelmed with warming climate and rising sea levels, facing disasters — such as hurricanes, storm surges which are now more frequent and severe.</p>'+
  '<p>The people on Sapelo Island lack both the disaster and legal assistance necessary to build-back and preserve their ancestral lands. As a direct result of flooding, hurricane and storm surge, they have already lost much of their ancestral land leading to outward migration to the mainland, leaving the community with vacant lots.</p>';

  "<p>Although Hurricane season is approaching, there is action being taken to prepare for disasters. Inundation by the saltwater sea is an issue that continues to impact lives on Sapelo, however there are currently little resources to be truly resilient in the face of rising tides. Known as King Tides, these waters impact the land and therefore agriculture and self-sustained food access on the island.  </p>"+

Even in the face of long-term population decline, climate change and other threats, the community who returns to shore up their land and what remains craft a powerful message of preservation and perseverance. </p>"+
