Today, as a structural and unsolved problem, the community of Sandtowtn is dealing with a frightening <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-food-desert-20150615-story.html" target="_blank">food desert</a>, where poor quality and availability worsen the residents\' current problems and especially damage their health, adding more troubles to a place full of them.  </p>' +
  '<p> The history of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/03/us/a-portrait-of-the-sandtown-neighborhood-in-baltimore.html?_r=0" target="_blank">decay</a> of Sandtown started in the late 1960s, particularly after the May 68 riots and the increase of drug use and violent crimes in the 1970s, which led many residents to flee and stores to close, despite government efforts made since the 1980s nothing has changed. Before this, Sandtown was known as <a href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/hh63sv958?locale=en#/6/8[xhtml00000004]!/4/4/1:0 " target="_blank">“Baltimore\'s Harlem\”</a> and inspired many cultural expressions across the US. Today it\'s easily possible to see the decay of the neighborhood in the high percentage of vacant building density; a high percentage of working-age residents unemployed; high rate of community population incarcerated; a low average household income; but especially in the high percentage of area covered by food desert, which is complemented by an insufficient provision of healthy food among the existing markets and grocery stores. So, even though the <a href=" https://health.baltimorecity.gov/programs/food-access" target="_blank">Baltimore City Health Department</a> and the <a href="https://clf.jhsph.edu/publications/researching-baltimore-city-food-environment" target="_blank">John Hopkins Center</a> for a Livable Future have started research and programs, their implementations and the urban renewals haven\'t had any positive repercussions on the community of Sandtown so far.</p>'+

In this chart, Sandtown-Winchester occupies a complicated place among the neighborhoods of Baltimore.

  "<p>The racial makeup of Sandtown is crucial to understand, while racial injustices and police harassment have been increasing throughout the years. This reality was crystalized by the murder of Freddy Gray, which has shaped the public opinion about Sandtown and the inner relationships of the neighborhood. Besides, with 3% of the population incarcerated, it has more residents in prison than any other neighborhood in Baltimore. This creates a direct relationship between race makeup and police harassment, and social injustices. </p>"+
  "<p>In addition to these issues, it is important to highlight that the percentage of children in single-parent households is 86.8%. </p>"+

On the other hand, it has a high unemployment rate of 20.7%, making it the sixth highest within Baltimore’s areas, with a median of 13.1%. Also, the median household income is $24,374, ranking 50 among 55 areas in the city, and it's at or below 185% of the Federal Poverty Level.

  "<p>It's 17 among 55 in carryout density and 7 among 55 areas in corner store density, but it's 42 among 55 areas in Fast Food Density, creating a bad dependency on unhealthy food. Liquor stores represent 7.4% (the City has a 3.8%), and tobacco stores' density represents 39.6% (the City has a 20.9%). All percentages represent the poor quality of food available inside Sandtown, which harms its residents even more.  </p>"+
  "<p>People of Sandtown are the sixth (over fifty-five) more likely to die from diabetes and are more vulnerable to obesity. The life expectancy at birth is 70 years old, while the city has 3.6 more years, and the rate of Hepatitis C is 69.1%, while the city is 35.0%. In the end, for the residents of Sandtown, it means experiencing more health problems than residents of other locations with more accessibility and quality of food stores and services in general. </p>"+

Then, the video shows how walking for several minutes isn't easy to find healthy food while instead, it's more possible to find a liquor store or a corner store with fast food or just unhealthy food. This video is meant to expose the quotidian dilemma of the residents of this part of Baltimore.</p>";

  "<p>After reviewing the most incident factors related to food availability in Sandtown, it is possible to notice the severe damage caused not only for structural scarcities and racial injustices occurring since the 1970s but also because of an extreme food desert that harms the existing population affecting them with health complications. There aren't enough markets nearby where the residents of Sandtown could buy fresh and healthy food, but they also have to commute long distances, wasting time and expending extra money. On top of that, the existing supply in the neighborhood is extremely low, directly affecting the entire population of Sandtown, especially the most vulnerable people. But, there isn't only bad news. Even though the implemented food programs aren't having much success until today, there is a positive signal on the variety of programs that the Baltimore City Health Department is applying in conjunction with the <a href=\"https://clf.jhsph.edu/sites/default/files/2019-05/researching-baltimore-food-environment-report-2015.pdf\">Johns Hopkins</a> <a href=\"https://clf.jhsph.edu/ \">Center for a Livable Future</a> along with the Bloomberg School Of Public Health. Programs such as the Baltimarket, the Virtual Supermarket Program, the Healthy Stores, the Food Justice Forum, <a href=\"https://planning.baltimorecity.gov/baltimore-food-policy-initiative \">the Baltimore Food Policy Initiative</a>, and the Mapping the Food Environment are trying to revert these issues. Hopefully, in the near future, these public initiatives and other types of programs could start to change the reality of this postponed neighborhood. </p>";
