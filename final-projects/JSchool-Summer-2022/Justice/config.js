  '<p>Just as COVID-19 pandemic created a greater need for food access in Detroit, Mich., the number of available grocery stores in the city decreased. Fewer Detroiters have access to grocery stores within a 15 minute walking distance compared to five years ago. The number of available grocery stores, independent and chain, in Detroit has also decreased from 2017 to 2022. Food banks experienced the pressure of providing to people who were without a job and students kept at home when the nationwide quarantine was first implemented. Now with rising inflation, Detroiters are feeling the need for affordable, accessible food options even more. That has carried throughout the last two years of the pandemic.</p>'+
  '<p>Alex Hill, creator of the Detroit Food Map, has been tracking grocery stores in Detroit for the past 12 years. Together he and Detroit Food Policy Counsel have surveyed residents every other year about their food security – a longstanding issue in the city.</p>'+
  '<p>“I usually pushed back on the food desert label,” he said, referring to it as a negative, and not particularly productive terminology. “But now the city has some newly emerging food deserts.”</p>'+

  "<p>Detroit had already seen the loss of <span class='highlight-pink'>10</span> full-service grocery stores and roughly 10-15 dollar stores replaced them.</p>"+
  "<p>Since dollar stores do not require the same product guidelines, they do not necessarily carry fresh produce or other grocery items that full-service stores do. In 2022, there are officially more dollar stores than grocery stores in Detroit.</p>"+
  "<p>Over the past five years, no grocery store closures took place in wealthier neighborhoods of Detroit.</p>"+

  "<h1 style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Increasing Food Insecurity in Detroit</h1>" +
 "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Since 2018, food insecurity in Detroit has increased significantly. Four years ago, 39% of Detroit households were found to be found insecure, according to the 2018 ALICE report. The number of food insecure households increased the following year to 45% of households total. Hill and the Detroit Food Policy Council estimates that that number might be closer to 70% with the string of full-service grocery store closures and growing economic stressors.</p>" +
  '<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">“During the pandemic it’s just been pandemonium,” said Hill. “The foodbox pickup lines proliferated during the pandemic."</p>'+
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Food boxes are services where residents can have access to prepared boxes of food that they could take home in lieu of visiting a food bank. Because of the saturation of resources, food pantries found themselves needing to be closed. The number of food pantries went from 200 to 21, according to Hill. Those that remained were the largest providers such as Gleaners who experienced an uptick in their distribution.</p>"+
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Gleaners was providing 46 million pounds of food annually before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the amount of food distributed by the food pantry shot up to 64 million pounds and then jumped to 71 million pounds in 2021. In addition to the increase in food provided to Detroiters, Gleaners also saw more first-time visitors during the pandemic than they had before, according to Kristin Sokul, Gleaners’ Director of Advancement Strategy & Planning.</p>"+
  '<p style="max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto">"Households with children were particularly hard hit due to school shutdowns preventing easy access to school-provided meals and childcare,” said Sokul.</p>'+
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>The uptick in need for food assistance provided by services like Gleaners and other food pantries has remained consistent since March 2020. Rising inflation is drawing even more people to Gleaners food distribution lines, but is also making operations more costly. Just last month, <a href='https://www.gcfb.org/food-banks-meal-programs-struggle-to-meet-rising-demand-as-federal-aid-runs-short/' target='_blank'>Gleaners CEO Gerry Brisson</a> said the organization had to dip into its reserves to continue operating."+
  '<div style="max-width:1200px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"><img src="images/food-costs-metro-detroit.png"/></div>' +
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Food costs in Detroit have indeed risen significantly since early 2019. Recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that basic necessities like meat, poultry, eggs and dairy have experienced a 30% increase in the Consumer Pricing Index.</p>"+
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>While the pandemic has left a lasting impact on Detroit food security. Alex Hill says he has seen people attempting to fill the gaps in food distribution through his research with the Detroit Food Map. He said during the pandemic, five different community fridges were introduced as well the Detroit chapter of Food Rescue USA. Many Detroit residents also volunteered for these new efforts that were addressing food insecurity in the face of the pandemic.</p>"
