  "<p>“With the drought like that of this year, I am getting only three months of irrigation,” Kenneth Costa, 78, a farmer in Fresno said. “Normally we would get four to five months in the past.”</p>" 

  let divChapter7 =
  "<p>Costa of <span style='background-color:#a3b18a;color:white'>Chateau Farms</span> owns 80 acres of land and said he’s allocated one day for each 20 acres of Fresno Irrigation District water. “The rest of the water we need, we draw from the aquifer,” he said.</p>" +
  "<p>He is planning to sell his land.</p>"  +
  "<p>“The drought, insect spray, growth spray, and other issues have made agriculture too expensive to continue,” he said.</p>";

  "<p>“We have a drought because of mother nature, but also a regulatory drought caused by the state and federal governments’ lack of commitment to taking action,” he said.</p>" +
  "<p>Merkley is a fourth-generation farmer and has seen many of his friends and neighbors’ farms go out of business over the years. </p>" +
  "<p>“Those that have stayed in the business have had to grow bigger,” he said. “Survival is very difficult for small-scale farmers now.”</p>" +

  let divChapter9 =

  "<p>California has also dealt with raging wildfires and heatwaves. How then are farmers sustaining the business and what is the future of farming in Fresno?</p>" +
  "<p>Even with warmer and drier summers, data shows the level of irrigation has gone down in the county.</p>" +
  "<p class='chart-title'> More irrigation water is needed per acre farmland in Fresno.</p>" +
  "<p class='sub-title'> The total acres of irrigated lands dropped 60% after 2000, while water usage decreased at a much slower pace since 2005.</p>" +

  "<p class='data-source'>Data Source: <a href='https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/water_use/'>USGS Water Use Data</a></p>" +
  "<p>“You can only grow commodities with the water you have,” Merkley said. “Rainfall is like our checking account. When that turns dry, we turn to our savings account meaning groundwater … The state has cleared up both for us,” he said pointing to lack of proper water management policies.</p>" +
  "<p>To stay afloat, farmers have found unique solutions. To cope with the lack of rainfall, many farmers in Fresno adopt drip irrigation systems, according to Costa. </p>" +
  "<p>“For months we don’t use irrigation water and depend on the aquifer to draw water,” he said. “That requires using pumps which consume a lot of electricity. It is quite expensive for us.”</p>" +
  "<p>Another solution is to fallow land, according to Jeanine Jones, interstate resources manager for the California Department of Water Resources. </p>" +
  "<p>Fallowing means to let plowed land be left unsown for some time to allow it to regain its fertility. </p>" +
  "<p>“At a very ballpark statewide scale, in the last two droughts, about 500,000 acres of agricultural land have been fallowed due to drought, and that's out of a little under nine million irrigated acres,” Jones said.</p>" +
  "<p>In response to less surface water being available in the form of rainfall, farmers have depended more on extracting groundwater, according to Robert Hutmacher, a plant science professor at University of California, Davis.</p>" +
  "<p>Lowered rainfall, combined with heatwaves are obvious indicators of an ongoing climate crisis. Despite this, the California State Board of Food and Agriculture heard a cautiously optimistic appraisal of agriculture’s future through 2050 from economist Dr. Daniel Sumner, director of the Agricultural Issues Center at UC Davis. </p>" +
  "<p>Thomas Tomich, a sustainability, science policy professor at University of California is optimistic the industry will do “just fine.”</p>" +
  "<p>“Our drought records go back hundreds of years and we’re in the biggest drought this place has ever seen,” Tomich said, adding that the county’s farmers depend mostly on groundwater for irrigation. </p>" +
  "<p>Without being able to recharge groundwater, Tomich said he expects a lot of irrigated land in the county to go out of production. That said, farmers are quickly adapting— by changing their crops to less water intensive ones.</p>" +
  "<p>Jones said switching crops is a trend that’s already happened.</p>" +
  "<p>“Because you know, farmers basically follow the markets,” he said. “At the San Joaquin Valley in 1980, or 1990, there were a lot of annual crops such as cotton because the market for cotton was good and they had ample water supplies for it. But as water supplies were reduced and water became more expensive, it was no longer profitable for growers to produce cotton.” </p>" +
  "<p>A majority of farmers subsequently switched to farming almonds, he added.</p>" +
  "<p class='chart-title'> Almonds and grapes dominate Fresno County agriculture production for 5 years</p>" +
  "<p><img src='images/crop-type.svg'></p>" +
  "<p class='data-source'>Data Source: <a href='https://www.co.fresno.ca.us/departments/agricultural-commissioner/fresno-county-crop-report-dmi'>Fresno County Crop Report</a></p>" +
  "<p>“For some commodities, California produces virtually all of U.S.’ production,” Tomich said. “For general categories, fruits and vegetables California produces half of what the US eats.” </p>" +
  "<p>That said, California’s agriculture being hit won’t necessarily impact food security in the country, Tomich is confident.</p>" +
  "<p>“If Americans started eating the diet that’s recommended by the U.S. goverment, we’d need 5 Californias. But, that’s not the case,” he said. “Nobody will starve because they couldn’t get a tomato or peach.”</p>" +
  "<p class='chart-title'> California is the largest agriculture-producing state receiving the most crop cash in 2020</p>" +

  "<p class='data-source'>Data Source: <a href='https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/exec/county/CountyCropReports.html'>California Agriculture Stats</a></p>" +
  "<p>Climate change aside, farmers also face other challenges.</p>" +
  "<p>“We are probably the only industry and producers that cannot set their own price,” Costa said. “We don’t get to set the prices we sell for. So we are unable to recoup as much of our expenses as we would.”</p>" +
  "<p>He added that even as food prices seem to have gone up, a bigger share of the increase is going to middlemen, instead of farmers.</p>" +
  "<p>“Almonds used to be $4 a pound. Now farmers get only $1 a pound,” he said.</p>" +
  "<p>What then is the solution?</p>" +
  "<p>One thing to work on is to build more storage, Merkley said. “With the growing conditions we have in California, agriculture isn’t going anywhere, but we need to act fast.</p>" +
  "<p>“I do not think we’re doomed,” Tomich said. “But we do need to be climate-smart. I don’t think any agriculture on the planet is sustainable right now.”</p>" +
  "<p>His recommendation would be to intervene in the industry through the energy sector. </p>" +
  "<p style='margin-bottom:100px'>“We need to move away from fossil fuels. Agriculture isn’t an easy fix, but not impossible,” he said. “California’s agriculture is very good at reinventing itself.”</p>"
