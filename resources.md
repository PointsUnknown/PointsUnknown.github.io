Here you will find a list of GIS and mapping resources, including data, tutorials, books, and blogs. Although this is by no means a complete or comprehensive list we hope it will provide guidance, ideas, inspiration, and help you in your mapping work.

# Data Sources
**Data resources at Columbia University:**

* [Digital Social Science Center (DSSC)](http://library.columbia.edu/locations/dssc.html): in Lehman Library is the chief GIS Data Library for the overall University. They purchase and maintain their own collection of data, including historical datasets for New York City, and have Data Librarians who are able to help students in both finding and working with geospatial data. The DSSC is located in Lehman Library in the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) at 118th Street and Amsterdam, and is open to all Columbia Students with a valid ID. Please refer to their website for hours.

* [GeoData@Columbia](https://geodata.library.columbia.edu/): hosted by the DSSC, this portal provides access to geographic data from the leading universities of the world.

* [SEDAC / CIESIN](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/): The Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) is a center within the Earth Institute at Columbia University. CIESIN works at the intersection of the social, natural, and information sciences, and specializes in on-line data and information management, spatial data integration and training, and interdisciplinary research related to human interactions in the environment. Along with NASA they produce the [Gridded Population of the World](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4) dataset, which models the distribution of human population (counts and densities) on a continuous global surface. This is probably the most complete and accurate global population dataset in the world.

**New York City data:**
