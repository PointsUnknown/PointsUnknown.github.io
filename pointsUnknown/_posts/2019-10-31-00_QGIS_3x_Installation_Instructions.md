# Overview
This tutorial will walk you through the installation of the following pieces of software:

* [Google Earth Pro](https://www.google.com/earth/) - Google Earth is a geobrowser that accesses satellite and aerial imagery, ocean bathymetry, and other geographic data over the internet to represent the Earth as a three-dimensional globe.

* [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/index.html) - A cross-platform free and open-source desktop geographic information system (GIS) application that provides data viewing, editing, and analysis.

* [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) - Adobe Illustrator is a paid application, although a free 1-week trial is available through Adobe. Typically, we focus our teaching around open-source tools. Unfortunately, open-source competitors fall short in a lot of the exercises we will take you through on Saturday. Adobe Illustrator is installed on the Journalism School’s lab computers, so you can use what you learned even without buying Illustrator for your laptop. So, prior to the workshop, please sign-up for the 1-week trial.
