# Overview
This tutorial will walk you through the installation of the following pieces of software:

* [Google Earth Pro](https://www.google.com/earth/) - Google Earth is a geobrowser that accesses satellite and aerial imagery, ocean bathymetry, and other geographic data over the internet to represent the Earth as a three-dimensional globe.

* [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/index.html) - A cross-platform free and open-source desktop geographic information system (GIS) application that provides data viewing, editing, and analysis.

* [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) - Adobe Illustrator is a paid application, although a free 1-week trial is available through Adobe. Typically, we focus our teaching around open-source tools. Unfortunately, open-source competitors fall short in a lot of the exercises we will take you through on Saturday. Adobe Illustrator is installed on the Journalism Schoolâ€™s lab computers, so you can use what you learned even without buying Illustrator for your laptop. So, prior to the workshop, please sign-up for the 1-week trial.
