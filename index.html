          <p>Our students are growing up in a society that is increasingly dependent on data and computation, a dependence that often evolves invisibly, without any critical assessment or accountability. In New York City, with its mandate to make data public, students have an opportunity to learn how to question data through journalistic lines of inquiry: What data are made public? What do they say about life in the city? How are neighborhoods rendered in data and what are the consequences of those representations? What undiscovered stories can be found in the data? Spatial training, paired with journalism, can serve as the missing “integrator” of data and the real world—providing lessons that travel beyond the boroughs of New York. The commoditization of spatial visualization tools can extend journalistic practice, helping reporters better understand and tell stories. These same tools expose the invisible spaces, forces and environments that architecture, urban design and planning students must engage, navigate and learn to represent as part of their spatial toolkit.

            Since its inception in 2012, Brown has been developing a pedagogical mission, helping to create new programs and host public-facing events that live at the intersection of data and computer science, design and journalism. Within the Graduate School of Journalism, for example, Brown created The Lede, a program to prepare postgraduate students with little or no computational experience for graduate studies that require familiarity with data, code and algorithms. Through these offerings and others, Brown has adopted a serious educational mandate and has been compiling experience in creating and administering educational programs.
            <br><br>
            CSR, established in 2015 and expanding from ten years of experience as theSpatial Information Design Lab,serves as a hub for spatial urban research that links design, architecture, urbanism, the humanities and data science. Housed in the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, CSR sponsors research and curricular activities built around new technologies of mapping, data visualization, and data collection and analysis. An example of this is Introduction to Mapping for Architecture, Urbanism and the Humanities, a course designed to equip students from across GSAPP and the humanities with spatial visualization and analysis training. An alternative version of this course was offered as an intensive summer workshop to humanities faculty, where they were introduced to concepts and methods of GIS analysis and worked with instructors to incorporate new skills of spatial analysis and visualization into their course assignments and syllabi.

          <p>
            Prior to launching the new offerings in October 2017, we will address the primary logistical and curricular challenges confronting the teaching modules. We will begin with an intensive 12-month research period. This will start with the appointment of a board of advisors comprised of reporters, graphic artists, engineers, visualization experts and cartographers. Prospects for this board can be found in the Potential Advisory Committee appendix of this document.
            <br><br>
            Throughout the 2016-17 academic year, we will conduct interviews of journalism, GSAPP and humanities students to gauge comprehension and potential impact of the program. Additionally, we will conduct focus groups of reporters, graphic artists, engineers, and cartographers. After distilling the insights gleaned from the interviews and focus groups, we will begin constructing a five-week module to be offered four times throughout the 2017-18 academic year for journalism students, and one1.5 credit workshop to be conducted in fall 2017 and spring 2018 for GSAPP students as part of their visual studies curriculum. Parallel to focus groups, the team will perform site visits to newsrooms of various sizes and types, to better understand current and potential applications of GIS and mapping in reporting, and potential applications of reporting and narrative in design practices.
            <br><br>
            The mapping and spatial data analysis module for journalism students, comprised of five, four-hour evening sessions, will touch on the topics of basic mapping techniques, table and spatial joins, georeferencing and creating new spatial data, raster data and web-mapping. Our intention is that the materials created during the first iteration of the module will also yield byproducts for future exploration within other schools in the university. The same basic topics will make up the 1.5 credit course for GSAPP students, with greater emphasis placed on using maps as a component of narrative practices and depictions of place. The module will rely heavily on open-source software and data, and the curriculum will be designed for reproducibility. Documentation and support documents will be posted and updated on Github, creating an open repository for further collaboration.

            Curricular Integration
          </h1>
          <p>
            In the School of Journalism, modules serve as not-for-credit experiences that complement traditional topics taught in standard reporting and writing classes.The mapping module will consist of five, four-hour sessions, and attendance of each will be mandatory for those who enroll. The five sessions will occur in the evenings on a weekly basis, and dinner will be provided. Each session will be taught by two faculty, as well as teaching assistants provided by Brown and CSR.Through The Lede, the Transparency Series, and others, Brown has garnered experience in running similar technically-oriented, and typically, well over-subscribed, offerings.
            <br><br>
            In the fall, M.S. students in the journalism program are placed in Reporting, a mandatory class focused on teaching the basics of reporting through a beat. Although some beats are topical, most focus on a borough, neighborhood or function of New York City. To best integrate into the curriculum, the fall-based modules will focus primarily on New York City data, allowing for easy access to varieties of structured data, fewer conflicts from mapping projections, access to guest lecturers tied intimately to the data, and seamless integration into Reporting classes. In the spring, the modules will allow for data from outside of New York City.
