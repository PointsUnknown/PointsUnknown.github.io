      <h1>Points Unknown - GSAPP Spring 2019</h1>
      <p>Society is increasingly dependent on data and computation, a dependence that often evolves invisibly, without any critical assessment or accountability. In New York City, with its mandate to make data public, students have an opportunity to learn how to question data through journalistic lines of inquiry: What data are made public? What data are kept hidden? Who was involved with what data are included and excluded? Who wasn't? What do they say about life in the city? How are neighborhoods rendered in data and what are the consequences of those representations? What undiscovered stories can be found in the data?</p>
      <p>This course was designed and is taught as a bridge between disciplines — journalism and architecture. In journalism, data has emerged as an essential component of the trade, and yet working with spatial data, both as products in stories and, more critically, as emerging and little-explored tools for reporting, continues to be a novelty. In parallel, and in spite of their training in visual literacy and basic map-making skills, architects too frequently treat spatial data as a neutral backdrop into which their designs will be inserted. Literacy with spatial data analysis, mapping and storytelling have yet to become an integral part of the design process. Spatial training paired with journalistic techniques can serve as a missing “integrator” of data and the real world — providing lessons, stories, and designs that travel beyond the boroughs of New York.</p>
      <p>Points Unknown will provide students an opportunity to explore new forms of site analysis. Through pairing the processes of architecture and techniques of journalism, this course will explore sites of New York City and the Hudson Valley Region. Students will propose a site to investigate from a set of site topics identified for their unique connection to the city, their centrality to demographic populations, and their environmental impact — water, waste, transit, justice, and ecology & resiliency.</p>
      <p>Students will work in groups under the direction of a practicing journalist who will serve as editor to help groups explore and report on their site, spending the semester researching and constructing a geospatial narrative. Students will learn how to investigate the site and will select a particular issue to address. They will conduct research, interviews, perform exploratory and advanced data analysis, and learn various geospatial visualization techniques to produce a comprehensive narrative. From spatial association to pattern analysis, geostatistics to classification, students will employ statistical and analytical processes that both informs their reporting and defines their narratives.</p>
      <p>The final output will come in the form of a presentation that successfully highlights an identified problem of the site, posits evidence through novel implementations of data, and provides a comprehensive narrative through geospatial representations. In addition, the research will surface recommendations for site intervention.</p>

            Course Objectives
          </h1>
          <p>A wide array of available spatial-visualization tools can extend journalistic practice, helping reporters better find, understand, and tell stories. These same tools can expose the invisible spaces, forces, and environments that architecture, urban design, and planning students must engage, navigate, and learn to represent as part of their spatial toolkit.</p>
          <p>Points Unknown will task students with producing cartographic narratives, investigating a site utilizing principles borrowed from both journalistic and architectural practice.</p>
          <p>Key objectives include:</p>
          <p><ul>
            <li>Building core competency in spatial analysis and visualization, including data acquisition, cleaning, analyzing and visualizing; multi-criteria decision analysis; spatial statistics and network analysis</li>
            <li>Producing a cohesive cartographic narrative that tells a compelling story about a site</li>
            <li>Introducing core journalistic training, including reporting and interviewing techniques, into architectural and design practice practice</li>
            <li>Integrating design principles and spatial and data analysis into journalistic practice</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Each class will commence with a discussion based on readings assigned in the previous session. Students should participate in these discussions, and instructors will ensure that all students in the class are actively engaged. Class participation will be wrapped into your attendance grade.</p>
          <p>The core deliverable of this course is a group assignment due at the end of the semester, and the majority of assignments work towards producing graphics and narratives to be incorporated in the final. Despite this, all mapping (4) and reporting (3) assignments will be completed, submitted, and graded individually.</p>

              <li>Cumulative Mapping Assignments (30%)</li>
