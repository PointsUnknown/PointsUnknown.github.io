  "<p>In terms of food security, almonds are a great protein. It can literally feed the world … but a lot of farms are going out of business,” says Gary Soiseth, a third generation almond grower in the heart of California’s Central Valley.</p>";

  "<p>California is experiencing its driest period since the Vikings and the Mayans. As water is running out, almond growers in the Central Valley are tearing up their orchards. Reduced production has severe local and global impacts as the region is responsible for the entire almond supply domestically and around 80% of the global supply.</p>";

  "<p>The ongoing drought will impact the almond industry as fewer water will be allocated in the same amount of plot. Gary has two parcels of almond farm that receive water from different sources. In one of his lands, he receives surface water from the old irrigation canal district. Before the drought became severe, he used to receive an average of 32 inches per year. However, this is now cut to 18 inches, implying that 18 inches of water has to be spread out on the same patch of land that used to receive 32 inches. The reduced amount of water stresses out the trees and forces earlier irrigation.</p>";

  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>As can be seen in the chart above, subway usage collapsed abruptly right after the first COVID-19 case was documented in the city. It was in fact the declaration of a state of emergency, on March 7, 2020, that precipitated this near total drop in subway ridership.</p>" +

  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>His other patch of land uses drip irrigation, which does not have access to surface water. Due to the ongoing drought, Gary had to rip out the pump and dig 150 feet into the ground with three other farmers, which cost around $75,000. They have no choice but to tap into new water reserves.</p>" +
  "<p style='max-width:600px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>Gary also mentioned a well that was drilled with eleven others for communal use. It was the first time in 40 years that they decided to use the water from the well. He said his yields were down by 10 to 15%, pressuring him to cut down on fertilizers or skip a season for pruning. </p>";

  "<p>The region’s agriculture and water use are currently under major political debate. Tensions have arisen between the water use policies for agriculture and conservation due to ground water scarcity. This year, the Central Valley Project, a federal program that delivers water to the region through dams, reservations and canals, has not planned any allocation of water to the agriculture sector.</p>";

  "<p>The Trump Administration increased water supply to the region, but under the current Biden Administration, the priority has shifted to environmental conservation. This means less water is allocated to farmers, turning them to rely heavily on groundwater. This comes in conflict with the 2014 California Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) that aims to conserve and manage groundwater levels. “Electorates fight for us, but they are bureaucratic and they’ve never been here.”</p>";
